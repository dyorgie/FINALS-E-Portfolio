            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%;">Media literacy is the ability to recognize, analyse, decode, comprehend and understand different forms of media present.
            Since media comes in different forms, media literacy allows people to fully understand it regardless of form, and be
            able to form their own opinion and idea if needed. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%;">Information literacy is the ability to find, analyse, organise, utilise, and communicate different types of information,
            mainly used for decision-making, problem-solving and research. There are different thinking skills involved, mainly
            critical and problem-solving skills that makes a person literate in handling information. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%;">Technology literacy is the ability of a person to effectively use technology in all of its forms. Whether they are
            working independently or in collaboration, to be literate in technology they must be able to handle it responsibly and
            appropriately to communicate, manage, access, etc. information. </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 5%;">Media, information, and technology literacy affects society in a number of ways. First, the media. While media has been
            present for a long time now, it has been much more apparent in recent years, so much so that the youth is exposed to it
            at a much younger age compared to their parents. Now, with it being more and more present in our daily lives, everyone
            must be literate with media as it has a lot of influence. Journalism can be considered as a media, and we all know how
            important journalism is, but what is dangerous is if we do not understand or do not know how to use the information we
            have been presented. Which also ties into information literacy. While we know that journalism presents facts, we cannot
            deny that there is some bias present, and we need to analyse the data we have read ourselves. We know journalism can
            shape the opinions and ideas of the masses so it’s not good to just accept it for what it is. Another way how
            information literacy affects our society is through social media. Besides fake news itself which we need to look out for
            as well, people are often misunderstood in social media, mainly because most of the things are just seen on a screen or
            read by other users instead of it being actually heard in a normal conversation. I think if we truly possess information
            literacy, we would be able to widen our perspective regarding the things we see on social media, and always have a
            mindset that there is always something more to it than just what we see. Lastly, technology literacy. Just like the
            media, where it has become apparent in recent years, we cannot deny the fact that technology has basically integrated
            itself in our daily lives, and it won’t be long until we actually can’t live without it. Just right now, when the world
            is under a global pandemic, technology has been such a great help that if we were to remove it, a lot of things would be
            different. Technology affects our society in both good and bad ways, so it is up to us to be literate and be able to use
            it responsibly and for the better.
